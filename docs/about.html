            Hey, this is my about page, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 500px;" class="white">
            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.I like rain in summer. I like to sleep late, I like to get up late; I like to be alone. I like countryâ€™s peace; I like the beautiful lake in taal Batangas, I like the tall buildings in Makati. I like delicious food; I like action and comedy movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
        </p>
        <p class="wew">
          I always wanted to be a great basketball player, like Tim Duncan who played for the Spurs in NBA, or like Mark Pingris of Star Hotshots in PBA. They have inspired millions of people through their greatness. I also wanted to be a great Scientist, like Archimedes or Benjamin Franklin, who created some of the greates inventions. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some training, and some research. But my dream is still alive.
